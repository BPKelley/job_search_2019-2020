# Ben Kelley's 2019-2020 job search

My job search lasted from October 2019 to June 2020. I was looking for that next big step -- and I did it while *still employed*, which meant I could take my time, avoid stress, and only apply to interesting/valuable roles. 

There were also a few disruptions during that period (as you may recall!), which added some time to my search.

## Rough timeline

1. October-December 2020: I started fairly casually by only applying at *internal* jobs. However, it's well-known brand name (you have 100% heard of it), so those jobs had high competition. I got to the interview stage for all of them, but didn't receive any offers.
2. Early December 2019 - early January 2020: the holiday lull. I kept applying, but recruiters were slow to reply. (I don't mean to blame the recruiters themselves, since it was probably the *hiring managers* -- whatever the reason, it was slower).
3. January 2020-March 2020: the cycle continued. Applications, interviews, and a few 2nd/3rd interviews -- but no offers.
4. March 2020-April 2020: COVID-19 started. EVERYTHING paused for a while, since absolutely nobody knew what was happening or how it would affect the future.
5. April 2020-May 2020: things actually picked back up *relatively* quickly (in hindsight). Continued applying and interviewing.
6. May 14, 2020: formally **accepted an offer** from my new employer.
